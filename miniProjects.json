    "description": "My first major coding project was building a maze game in Python during freshman year where the goal was to reach the exit by moving up, down, left, and right. At the time, I struggled—I relied heavily on Stack Overflow, copy-pasted code, and ended up with 600+ lines I barely understood. Later, I revisited the project with a structured approach. I re-coded it in a single Jupyter notebook in just 128 lines, fully understanding the flow and being able to explain each component. To push myself further, I migrated it to JavaScript with a simple frontend so players could interact with the maze, adding more complexity but also proving to myself I could overcome the impostor syndrome I felt after college.",
