		"Hi! I'm Martina Reyes and I'm 24 years old. My nickname is MatÃª and my preferred pronouns are she/her. I graduated high school from Saint Pedro Poveda College in 2019. I completed undergraduate degree as cum laude in Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science and Analytics from the Ateneo de Manila University. I am currently a Master of Science student taking up Computer Science in the same university while working as a Junior Software Engineer at UBX.";

	const content2 =
		"I had no prior experience in coding entering college. Half of my college experience was spent at home during the COVID-19 pandemic, so I decided to expose myself as much as I can during my four years by joining workshops hosted by our home organization - Computer Society of the Ateneo (CompSAt) and projects that exposed me to web development and use different web frameworks. I took a few online courses on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I took Web Accessibility and Creative CSS Development electives. I learned how to use React, Django and CSS pre-processors (Tailwind CSS, SASS and STYLUS). I also learned the UX research process through my invovement with User Experience Society and my Human Computer Interaction class. The social-distancing set-up taught me to be as resourceful and resilient when it came to learning a new skill.";

	const content3 =
		"I aspire for a career in Data Science and/or Software Engineering. I enjoy learning and using platforms such as Coursera and Kaggle to increase my Data Science and Analytics skills. I have taken a few database classes that use SQL and noSQL (MongoDB and DynamoDB). I am also familiar with the basic usage of Tableau and Tableau Prep Builder from my Data Visualization elective and my first internship at Dashlabs.ai, a local health software company. A few months later, I got another remote internship as a Frontend and Data intern at a start-up called WiV, a wine investment company.";

	const content4 =
		"Currently, I am taking up my Master of Science degree in computer science. I chose to take this to further improve on working as an individual and expand on my undergraduate thesis on a national scale. I took a Data Science Apprenticeship at Opswerks last February-May 2024 to explore my career options. It was a fulfilling experience because it was my first on-site, hands-on professional work experience. The overall experience inspired me to hone my technical skills and made me realize I work best within a team setting. After the apprenticeship, I presented my research on the international stage at a public health conference held in Bankok, Thailand last August 2024.";

	const content5 =
		"Now, nearly finished with my Master's, I am working as a Junior Software Engineer at UBX. Once I complete my master's, I intend to focus on my career. I've been interested in taking on a full-stack developer role. My personal goal is to use the knowledge, skills, and understanding learned in my field to help other people. I advocate for creating a positive social impact through my work and the skills I have to offer. I work well individually but perfer working collaboratively on a team. I empathize with others, value inclusive environments and adapt a growth mindset in any project or task I partake in.";
