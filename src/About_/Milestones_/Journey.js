    const content = "Hi! I'm Martina Reyes and I'm 24 years old. My nickname is MatÃª and my preferred pronouns are she/her. I graduated high school from Saint Pedro Poveda College in 2019. I completed undergraduate degree as cum laude in Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a specialization in Data Science and Analytics from the Ateneo de Manila University. I am currently a Master of Science student taking up Computer Science in the same university while working as a Junior Software Engineer at UBX.";
    
    const content2 = "I had no prior experience in coding entering college. Half of my college experience was spent at home during the COVID-19 pandemic, so I decided to expose myself as much as I can during my four years by joining workshops hosted by our home organization - Computer Society of the Ateneo (CompSAt) and projects that exposed me to web development and use different web frameworks. I took a few online courses on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I took Web Accessibility and Creative CSS Development electives. I learned how to use React, Django and CSS pre-processors (Tailwind CSS, SASS and STYLUS). I also learned the UX research process through my invovement with User Experience Society and my Human Computer Interaction class. The social-distancing set-up taught me to be as resourceful and resilient when it came to learning a new skill."
    
    const content3 = "I aspire for a career in Data Science and/or Software Engineering. I enjoy learning and using platforms such as Coursera and Kaggle to increase my Data Science and Analytics skills. I have taken a few database classes that use SQL and noSQL (MongoDB and DynamoDB). I am also familiar with the basic usage of Tableau and Tableau Prep Builder from my Data Visualization elective and internship at Dashlabs.ai, a local health software company. My first internship was working remotly as a Data Analyst at Dashlabs.AI. A few months later, I got another remote internship as a Frontend and Data intern at a start-up called WiV, a wine investment company." 
    
    const content4 = "Currently, I am taking up my Master of Science degree in computer science. I chose to take this to further improve on working as an individual and expand on my undergraduate thesis on a national scale. I took a Data Science Apprenticeship at Opswerks last February-May 2024 to explore my career options. It was a fulfilling experience because it was my first on-site, hands-on professional work experience. The overall experience inspired me to hone my technical skills and made me realize I work best within a team setting. After the apprenticeship, I presented my research on the international stage at a public health conference held in Bankok, Thailand last August 2024."
    
    const content5 = "Now, nearly finished with my Master's, I am working as a Junior Software Engineer at UBX. Once I complete my master's, I intend to focus on my career. I've been interested in taking on a full-stack developer role. My personal goal is to use the knowledge, skills, and understanding learned in my field to help other people. I advocate for creating a positive social impact through my work and the skills I have to offer. I work well individually but perfer working collaboratively on a team. I empathize with others, value inclusive environments and adapt a growth mindset in any project or task I partake in."

                    In my third year, I was <a href='https://feature-about-page-ebac-22--compsat.netlify.app/about' className='underline'>Secretary-General of CompSAt</a>. I worked alongside different departments that led the organization. My main tasks were internal-based: to document what was happening in the org for the other departments. I was given the opportunity to lead a project that revived an old newsletter of the organization: Compress. The team was made of designers and writers and led by the Documentations and Creatives Department of the org. The aim was to showcase what the organization was all about, given the social-distancing aspect.
